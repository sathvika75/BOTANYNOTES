            <h2>Prophase</h2>
               <pre class="fontstyle">
                 Prophase is the initial phase of mitosis and meiosis, a period of cell division where<br>
                chromosomes condense and become visible, and the mitotic spindle begins to form. During<br>
                prophase DNA, which was diffuse chromatin during interphase, condenses into distinct chromosome.

                Key events during prophase:

                Chromatin Condensation:
                The genetic material, initially in a loosely organized form called chromatin, condenses and coils up,<br>
                becoming visible as individual chromosomes. 

                Sister Chromatid Formation:
                Each chromosome is composed of two identical sister chromatids, joined at the centromere, giving them<br>
                an X-shaped appearance. 

                Mitotic Spindle Formation:
                The mitotic spindle, which is composed of microtubules, begins to form from the centrosomes (or poles <br>
                in plant cells). 

                Nuclear Envelope Breakdown:
                The nuclear envelope, which surrounds the nucleus during interphase, begins to break down. </br></pre>

                  <h2>Metaphase</h2>
                  <pre class="fontstyle">
                         Metaphase is a crucial stage in cell division (mitosis and meiosis) where chromosomes, <br>
                         which have already replicated and condensed, are aligned at the center of the cell. <br>
                         This alignment ensures the during the subsequent phase (anaphase), <br>
                         each daughter cell receives a complete and equal set of chromosomes.

                         Key Features of Metaphase:

                         Condensed Chromosomes:
                         Chromosomes are at their most condensed state, making them easily visible under a microscope.

                         Nuclear Envelope Disintegration:
                         The nuclear envelope, which normally surrounds the nucleus, breaks down, allowing the chromosomes<br>
                         to move freely in the cytoplasm. 

                         Chromosome Alignment:
                         Sister chromatids (identical copies of a chromosome joined at the centromere) are aligned at the <br>
                         metaphase plate (an imaginary line in the center of the cell). 

                         Metaphase Checkpoint:
                         A checkpoint ensures that all chromosomes are properly attached to the spindle microtubules before<br>
                         the cell progresses to anaphase.

                  <h2>Anaphase</h2>
                  <pre class="fontstyle">
                       Anaphase is the stage of cell division where replicated chromosomes, called sister chromatids,<br>
                       separate and move to opposite poles of the cell. This occurs after metaphase and precedes telophase<br>
                       in both mitosis and meiosis. The separation of chromatids is crucial for ensuring each daughter cell<br>
                       receives a complete and identical set of chromosomes.

                       Key Events in Anaphase:

                       Chromatid Separation:
                       The centromeres holding sister chromatids together divide, and each chromatid becomes an independent<br>
                       chromosome.

                       Chromosome Movement:
                       The mitotic spindle, composed of microtubules, pulls the separated chromosomes towards opposite poles of<br>
                       the cell.

                       Two Phases (Anaphase A and Anaphase B): 
                       Anaphase A: The movement of chromosomes towards the spindle poles is facilitated by shortening<br>
                       microtubules. 
                       Anaphase B: The two poles of the cell move further apart, further aiding in chromosome separation.

                          <h2>Telophase</h2>
                          <pre class="fontstyle">
                            Telophase, the final stage of mitosis and meiosis, marks the point where duplicated chromosomes, <br>
                            previously separated at the poles of the cell, are enclosed by new nuclear membranes, forming two <br>
                            distinct nuclei. It also involves the breakdown of the mitotic spindle and the decondensation of the<br>
                            chromosomes, making them less visible. This stage is followed by cytokinesis, where the cell divides <br>
                            into two daughter cells. 

                            Key features of telophase:

                            Nuclear membrane reformation:
                            New nuclear envelopes form around each set of chromosomes, creating two separate nuclei within the <br>
                            cell. 

                            Spindle disassembly:
                            The spindle apparatus, responsible for chromosome movement, breaks down.

                            Chromosome decondensation:
                            The chromosomes, which were tightly coiled during earlier stages, uncoil and become less condensed,<br>
                            returning to their "stringy" form.

                            Cytokinesis:
                            The cytoplasm divides, resulting in two separate daughter cells, typically following telophase.

                            Occurs in both mitosis and meiosis:
                            Telophase occurs in both mitosis, a process of cell division that creates two identical daughter <br>
                            cells, and meiosis, which results in the production of four non-identical daughter cells. In meiosis,<br>
                            telophase occurs twice, as telophase I and telophase II.
