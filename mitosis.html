                             Mitosis, a crucial part of the cell cycle, involves a series of distinct phases,<br>
                             generally considered to be prophase, prometaphase, metaphase, anaphase, <br>
                             and telophase, followed by cytokinesis. <br>
                             Each phase involves specific events related to chromosome organization,<br>
                             separation, and nuclear envelope breakdown and re-formation. <br>

                                 Cytokinesis typically begins during anaphase or telophase, depending on the cell type.<br>
                                 It involves the division of the cytoplasm and the formation of new cell membranes,<br>
                                 resulting in two separate daughter cells. In animal cells, a cleavage furrow pnches<br>
                                 the cell membrane in two, while in plant cells, a cell plate forms to create a new cell wall.<br>

                                 Overlapping Stages:<br>

                                 Cytokinesis often begins during or immediately following telophase, making it a crucial step<br>
                                 in completing the cell cycle after mitosis. This overlap highlights the close relationship<br>
                                 between nuclear and cytoplasmic division during cell division. <br>
